## The results

1. **High-dimensional sphere packing:** Improved asymptotic upper bounds on
   sphere-packing density, reaching the Cohn–Elkies threshold.
   ([`SpherePacking.lean`](SpherePacking.lean))
2. **Binary and spherical codes:** Exponentially stronger upper bounds for
   binary codes at every minimum distance, together with corresponding bounds
   for spherical codes. ([`MetricCodes.lean`](MetricCodes.lean))
3. **Non-sofic groups:** A construction of a non-sofic group, resolving whether
   every group admits finite permutation approximations.
   ([`NonSoficGroup.lean`](NonSoficGroup.lean))
4. **Connes’s rigidity conjecture:** A counterexample to the conjecture that
   certain groups are determined by their group von Neumann algebras.
   ([`ConnesRigidity.lean`](ConnesRigidity.lean))
5. **Arithmetic circuit complexity:** New lower bounds for computing the
   permanent with arithmetic circuits and formulas, including an
   $n^4 / \log n$ formula lower bound.
   ([`Permanent.lean`](Permanent.lean))
6. **Quantum parallel repetition:** Exponential parallel repetition for
   arbitrary finite, two-player quantum games.
   ([`QuantumParallelRepetition.lean`](QuantumParallelRepetition.lean))
7. **Closest vector problem:** Polynomial-factor hardness of approximation for
   the closest vector problem, with related consequences for decoding and
   lattice problems. ([`GapCVP.lean`](GapCVP.lean))
8. **Ehrhart’s volume conjecture:** The sharp maximum volume in every dimension
   for a convex body whose centroid is its only interior lattice point.
   ([`EhrhartVolumeInequality.lean`](EhrhartVolumeInequality.lean))
9. **Multicolor Ramsey numbers:** A superexponential lower bound for multicolor
   triangle Ramsey numbers, resolving Erdős problem 183.
   ([`MulticolorTriangleRamsey.lean`](MulticolorTriangleRamsey.lean))
10. **Extremal number conjectures:** Counterexamples to the compactness and
    degeneracy conjectures in extremal graph theory, resolving Erdős problems
    146 and 180.
    ([`CompactnessAndDegeneracy.lean`](CompactnessAndDegeneracy.lean))

## Building the formalizations

The project uses Lean 4.32.0, mathlib, and Lake. With
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) installed, fetch the mathlib cache
and build all ten formalizations with:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build All
```

To build an individual formalization, pass its module name to Lake:

```sh
lake build SpherePacking
```

## Independent proof checking

For instructions on checking the formalizations with Comparator, see the
[ComparatorChallenges README](ComparatorChallenges/README.md).
